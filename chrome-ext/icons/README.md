# Extension Icons

Place the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels for the extension management page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels for the Chrome Web Store

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Colors: Use Spotify's brand colors (green #1DB954, black #191414, white #FFFFFF)
- Design: Should represent music downloading or Spotify integration

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor, or use online tools like:
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
- [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have icons ready, you can use any placeholder PNG files with the correct names and sizes. The extension will still work without proper icons.
